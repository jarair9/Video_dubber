The system is now "Studio Grade", but if you want to reach Hollywood Level, here are the 3 final missing pieces:

Face Restoration (Fixing the "Blurry Mouth"):
Problem: The current AI (Wav2Lip) generates lips at low resolution (96p), so the mouth looks slightly blurry compared to the rest of the HD video.
Fix: Integrate CodeFormer or GFPGAN. These are "Face Enhancer" AIs that sharpen the face after lip-syncing.
Auto-Subtitles (Burned In):
Problem: The video is dubbed, but text on screen remains English.
Fix: Generate Hindi/Urdu Subtitles and burn them into the video automatically using ffmpeg.
Background Noise Removal (Clean Plate):
Problem: Sometimes the AI voice has slight static, or the background music removal leaves "ghost vocals".
Fix: Add a "Voice Isolation" pass using a model like UVR5 (Ultimate Vocal Remover) before cloning.
Recommendation: Start with #1 (Face Restoration). It makes the biggest visual difference. Shall I implement that? (It requires downloading another AI model).
